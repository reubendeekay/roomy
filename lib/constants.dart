It’s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing\nWhen you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the Travely Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering your Host Service under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing. You are also agreeing to pay applicable fees like Travely’s service fee (and applicable taxes) for each booking. Travely Payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method.
